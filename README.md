THE PROBLEM:

Optimize a pipeline between a reservoir and a water treatment plant to have the lowest construction cost.

A simple schematic of the problem can be found below:         
                   Reservoir
                   /   |   \
                  A    B    C
                   \  /    /
                    D     /
                      \  /
                      WTP

For this problem a cost per each unit length of pipe was created. This accounted for slope, pipe diameter, and pipe length.
Pipe segments with a higher slope, pipe diameter, and pipe length had larger costs. These values can be changed to match
needs of other pipeline routing problems.

THE SOLUTION: uses General Algebraic Modeling System with mixed integer programming (MIP)
